**The power of participatory story mapping: Advancing equitable development in disadvantaged neighborhoods**

>_Lung-Amam and Dawkins investigate the importance in participatory mapping through a case study of a mapping project conducted in the community of Langley Park, Maryland. Langley Park is a predominantly low-income Latino migrant neighborhood facing the threat of displacement as a consequence of a new rail line being constructed through the neighborhood. The article describes various challenges in developing maps through lived experiences from issues with the digital divide to who is the author and narrator of these stories at the end of the process. The authors also highlight some of the advantages of story telling mapping from identifying specific infrastructures that hold both cultural and practical importance that would be hard to decipher for developers, investors, and public officials that do not interact with the community as closely as its residents. The authors conclude the article by making the case for how maps informed by community residents can help bring a sense of community and shared values to a neighborhood. It can be used as an important tool to invest and strengthen the already existing and valued built environment and identify areas and types of infrastructure that community residents may truly need. The article showcases this by highlighting some of the social gathering spaces, local businesses, and community based institutions that were identified as critical structures in the neghborhood._

>_The article was a good reminder of the importance of not only using planning tools to engage residents but also using them to create processes to empower and create a sense of autonomy over the information community residents are providing. I appreciated the authors intention in uplifting the importance of community voices in mapping and data analysis while also being critical of the current limitations to make this process truly empowering for community residents. I agree with the authors in questioning the power of "professionals" and "experts" when it comes to trying to popularize technical and digital tools that can be used to give residnents more power to decide and advocate for the built environment they want to see developed in their communities. If the experts and professionals have the final say and authority over the data collected then we should question if the processes we may are creating to popularize and engage residents is really deconstructing the traditional structures or reinforcing them in a different way. The creation of maps and stories are only the beginning and not the end game. Some public agencies unfortunately perpetrate some of the flaws outlined in this article in that they extract information from residents and only return to the community once they have analyzed the data and produced some visual to show. However, residents do not have a say for how the information gets interpreted which can ultimately limit the impact of the data if important information shared from the community is lost in the process. How the information is gathered and who has control over the final analysis of the data are important things to keep in mind as we move forward and try to make data more accesible to communities facing digital divide and access to information challenges._
