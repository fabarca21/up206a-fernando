# Reaction to Geoff Boeing Readings

*After these readings on Geoff Boeing's OSMnX tool, I am looking forward to seeing what type of spatial analysis the program will allow 
me to do. I am impressed by the program's capabilities and how it has been able to reproduce and make data scaleable for researchers 
interested in urban data analysis. The level of accuracy in the data was also another point that grabbed my attention. OSMnX has made the 
life of many researchers much easier. While the program's technical aspects were hard for me to follow personally as someone new to coding, 
mapping, and this level of sophisticated data analysis, what piqued my interest in learning more about the tool was its accessibility. 
Boeing had accessibility at the forefront of his priorities when developing the tool. Making it easy for people to acquire data, share
data, and build upon what already exists made me excited to learn the program.* 

*I hope that it is a program that I will come to master because, based on this reading, I think it is a great tool to do the level of 
analysis I would like without having the technical skillsets required with other programs. I also hope to learn it and pass it on to 
community-based organizations and groups that can definitely benefit from having access and knowledge to this tool. One of my goals is to 
pass some of this knowledge to folks organizing on the ground, which is why I appreciated Boeing's accessibility friendly approach to the 
development of the tool. Another point that I am interested in learning from Boeing is his recommendations for supporting Global South 
countries in data gzthering for them to develop their own maps to conduct spatial anlaysis to improve their cities.* 

# Questions for Geoff Boeing
*As mentioned above, how can researchers and planners from the Global North support Global South researchers in 
data gathering and sharing for them to conduct their own spatial analysis and come up with their own ideas as to how to make
their cities and roads more efficient in a way that is true to their needs and built environment capacity?* 

*What are ways to bridge some of the digital divide barriers that impede community residents and community groups from accessing
and learning abouyt these tools? Is there any advice on our role as planners/researchers in making this process a bit easier?*
