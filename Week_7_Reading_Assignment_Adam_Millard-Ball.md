# Reflection on Global trends toward urban street-network sprawl

_Barrington-Leigh and Millard-Ball's research showcases the power of open-source data as an essential tool to predict the possible future of urban expansion and its impact. However, it also demonstrates how it can create positive policy recommendations to improve the quality of life and the connectivity of people and communities. It was interesting to see that even though massive investment in infrastructure via roads and railways and streets in middle and higher-income cities has been made, connectivity among sprawling urban cities continues to decline. Even more alarming than the cities that have traditionally continued to sprawl and decrease in their connectivity networks are countries that are rapidly growing and getting little attention as their sprawling networks continuously fail to provide adequate connections for pedestrians._ 

# Questions:

_1.) One policy recommendation is advocating for more Grid type layouts to promote connectivity. In countries with difficult geographies where grid systems are more challenging to do is there an alternative to the type of connections planners can promote?_

_2.) What are some examples that you have seen from "low-income countries" regarding how they plan their cities to promote connectivity? And how have these connections allowed for economic growth? Or has it had no impact on that city or region's economy? If not, then why so?_
